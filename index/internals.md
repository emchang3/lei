## Internals

Léi streamlines your workflow, combining best-in-class tools to make the task of presenting your content easy. The back end leverages the well-loved micro-framework Sinatra, which pumps your Markdown content through Slim templates, styled by compiled Less files. The basic markup necessary for AMP-valid pages are baked into Léi as globals to drop into your views. Most importantly, generators are available to easily stub out new content streams and custom pages. A Gulp task is ready for you to run to pick up changes in .less. Sugar, spice, and everything nice.
