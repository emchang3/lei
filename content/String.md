# String

A String object holds and manipulates an arbitrary sequence of bytes, typically representing characters. String objects may be created using `String::new` or as literals.

Because of aliasing issues, users of strings should be aware of the methods that modify the contents of a String object. Typically, methods with names ending in `!` modify their receiver, while those without a `!` return a new String. However, there are exceptions, such as `String#[]=`.
